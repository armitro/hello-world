Joining the party.

My path started with a little house on the South side of the St Johns river.
Born on a Thursday, the 11th of February in the year of our Lord 1988, I was a little guy. 

My older brother was already there and more or less decided my name was Austin by the time I 
returned home from the hospital, probably with influence from my maternal grandmother.

So no Alexander Austin Holmes for me. Just Austin.
